We have all had dreams which stick with us all our lives.  Some have meaning and some have almost a Kafka like feeling.  The problem with either dreams or reality is that although they may speak the truth, no one will believe the message.

My dream enfolds in the lower corner of my world, where everyone is happy and content, the weather is warm and the sky is blue.   While being engaged in this fantasy I inadvertently wander off and climb higher and higher onto the surrounding hills until finally a point is reached where I could go no further or higher.  It had become  evident to me that the world that we live in is no more than a glass container or box.

Now the interesting part occurs when I make my way down to the people and see their reaction to this profound information.  Disbelief.   No!   Curiosity.  No!  Ridicule.  No!   Apathy.  Yes!  No one would come with me on my journey of truth. 

We all live in boxes of our own choosing.  We can't do anything about it until we recognize that we live in a box.

Each of us inhabits a world of many boxes that impinge on one another.  There is really no problem with living in a box until we find that it restricts us either physically or spiritually.   All of us have played in cardboard boxes when we were children.  It is now time to get out of the box.
